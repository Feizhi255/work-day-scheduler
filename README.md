# work-day-scheduler

Keep track of your scheduler with a day scheduler. From the hours of 9:00am to 10:00pm keep track of what u need to do.

## What I Learned
JavaScript is still hard, but this assaignment was a bit better. Local storage is easer then the other assignments. The only thing that got me the hardest was the tracker for what current time is displayed on the page.
